about.history = History
about.history.contents = <p><b>„Školský mikropočítač“</b> (school microcomputer) <b>PMI-80</b> was a single-board training microprocessor kit manufactured by Tesla Piešťany k. p., a Czechoslovak state-owned and state-run enterprise, between 1982 and 1983.  Based on a local clone of the Intel 8080A microprocessor, it was poorly designed and notoriously prone to failure.  The unreliability of its tape recorder interface was legendary.  Nonetheless, it gave a whole generation of Czechs and Slovaks their first hands-on experience of microprocessor and microcomputer technology and thus will be remembered forever (for more information see &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMI-80&gt;).</p><p>The original PMI-80 featured 1 KiB of EPROM and 1 KiB of RAM.  The emulator has 64KiB of memory, freely divisible between ROM and RAM, and unlike the real thing, its hardware, including the simulated cassette tape recorder, never fails.</p><p>Enjoy the ride!</p>
about.help = Help
about.help.contents = <h1>Keyboard</h2><p>The emulated computer\'s keyboard can be controlled with a mouse or the PC keyboard.  The assignment of most keys is natural and intuitive; for your reference, it is part of the tool tip displayed if you hold the mouse cursor over the button for several seconds.  It is possible to hold down (lock) a key by Ctrl-clicking it, but beware: the keyboard matrix used in PMI-80 was not fitted with diodes and as it is truly emulated, certain multi-key combinations will not be detected correctly.  The original firmware (monitor) suffered from poor detection of keypresses, but this should not be an issue with the emulator: all keypresses are interpreted as lasting no less than 20ms.</p><h1>Display</h1><p>The seven-segment display (SSD) elements in the original PMI-80 vary in brightness depending on the make-break ratio of the pulses powering them.  We did not think it necessary to emulate this feature and in the emulator, so the threshhold ratio is fixed at 1%.  Whenever a segment is powered for at least 1% of the 20ms time-slot, it is „on“, otherwise it is „off“.</p><p>There is one notable exception to this rule, namely the single-step mode of the debugger.  When the debugger is active, all hardware, including the display and the tape-recorder, virtualy freezes in time, and only the powered (selected) SSD element will be on.  Similarly, you must use the Ctrl-click technique if you wish to operate the keyboard in the debug mode.</p><h1>Tape recorder</h1>This is a simple cassette tape deck common in early 1980s.  It works just like the real thing, except that it records and replays the data with absolute precision.  All cassettes have 90 minutes of playing time, and a cassette can be saved or loaded to/from a hard drive by clicking the Eject button.</p><p>Four file formats are supported: the XML is the recommnded one, the TAP file is a compressed binary version of the same data, saving approx. 80% of space, the PMITAPE is used by a recent JavaScript emulator written by Martin Malý, and the SAM is a legacy format used by an older Windows-only emulator.</p>
