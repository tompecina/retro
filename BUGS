* Keyboard support for PMI-80 needs review.

* Sound must be reviewed and probably redone.

* About for PMD 85 missing.

* Implement command-line option for model selection.

* Update PMI-80 tape formats PMITAPE & SAM (and modify HW as needed).

* Icon size in some implementations limited to 128x128.

* Allow for different CPU frequency of PMD 85-3: + changes to trec/XML,
